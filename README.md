# Learning Cassandra

I'm following [this course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-cassandra) on LinkedIn Learning.

The idea is to get a basic understanding on how to configure, manage, and write/read data.

I'll be using Python, Docker, Kubernetes and [Astra - Datastax](https://astra.datastax.com/).

## Requirements

Install the latest python 3.11, according to the OS you have. After that you just need to install the project's dependencies, located in the requirements.txt.

## Run

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
