# Learning Cassandra

I'm following [this course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-cassandra) on LinkedIn Learning.

The idea is to get a basic understanding on how to configure, manage, and write/read data.

 I'll be using Python, Docker, Kubernetes and [Astra - Datastax](https://astra.datastax.com/).
